5. Get the off balance sheet liabilities

The system was unable to answer.

6. Give the Capitalised interest

Volex plc's annual report for the year ended 2024 explicitly states that interest expense on borrowings is not capitalised. These interest expenses are recognized within finance costs.
However, the Group does capitalise debt issue costs, which are fees associated with arranging and extending its bank facilities. These costs are then amortised over the term of the facility and recognized as part of finance costs.
Here are the details regarding these capitalised debt issue costs:
• Unamortised debt issue costs included within bank loans were $1.5 million as of 31 March 2024, down from $1.9 million in the prior year.
• The amortisation of debt issue costs charged to the income statement was $0.7 million for both the 2024 and 2023 periods.
• Specific capitalised amounts related to facility extensions include: 
• $0.3 million in 2024 for professional fees incurred when exercising a $40 million accordion to increase the committed facility.
• $0.5 million in the prior period (2023) for costs associated with a one-year extension request.


CASHFLOW TEMPLATE

1. Give the operating profit for recent past

Volex plc has shown an increase in its operating profit for the recent past, with figures available for both statutory operating profit and underlying operating profit. The underlying operating profit is considered a key measure of the business's core performance, as it excludes adjusting items and share-based payment charges.
Here's a breakdown of Volex plc's operating profit:
• For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 (FY2024):
• Statutory operating profit was $63.9 million. This represents an 18.8% increase compared to the prior year.
• Underlying operating profit reached $89.7 million. This is a 33% increase from FY2023. The underlying operating margin for FY2024 was 9.8%, an improvement of 50 basis points from the 9.3% achieved in FY2023, staying within the target range of 9% to 10%.
• For the financial year ended 2 April 2023 (FY2023):
• Statutory operating profit was $53.8 million.
• Underlying operating profit was $67.3 million.
• Five-Year Trend for Underlying Operating Profit (2020-2024):
• 2024: $89.7 million
• 2023: $67.3 million
• 2022: $56.2 million
• 2021: $42.9 million
• 2020: $31.6 million
The increase in operating profit in FY2024 was primarily driven by the acquisition of Murat Ticaret, strong organic growth, cost optimization, and favorable foreign exchange impact on retranslation of operating expenses. The Group has consistently delivered underlying operating margins within its 9-10% target range over the past four years.

2. Compare the total depreciation and amortisation for 2 years

Volex plc's total depreciation and amortisation for the two most recent financial years are as follows:
• For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 (FY2024):
• Depreciation of property, plant and equipment was $12.3 million.
• Depreciation of right-of-use assets was $7.4 million.
• Amortisation of intangible assets was $15.6 million.
• Total depreciation and amortisation for FY2024 was $35.3 million ($12.3m + $7.4m + $15.6m).
• For the financial year ended 2 April 2023 (FY2023):
• Depreciation of property, plant and equipment was $8.2 million.
• Depreciation of right-of-use assets was $4.8 million.
• Amortisation of intangible assets was $10.2 million.
• Total depreciation and amortisation for FY2023 was $23.2 million ($8.2m + $4.8m + $10.2m).
In summary, the total depreciation and amortisation increased from $23.2 million in FY2023 to $35.3 million in FY2024.

3. Check the status of stocks, creditors and debtors whether it has increased or decreased

Volex plc's financial statements for the recent past, comparing the year ended 31 March 2024 (FY2024) to the year ended 2 April 2023 (FY2023), show increases across stocks, creditors, and debtors:
• Stocks (Inventories):
• The Group's inventories increased from $120.5 million in FY2023 to $174.3 million in FY2024. This increase in inventory was noted to support growth.
• Creditors (Payables):
• Trade payables increased from $84.4 million in FY2023 to $133.1 million in FY2024.
• Other payables, accruals, and deferred income (including other taxes and social security) collectively increased from $66.6 million in FY2023 to $128.3 million in FY2024. 
• Specifically, other taxes and social security increased from $5.4 million to $7.9 million.
• Other payables, accruals, and deferred income increased from $61.2 million to $120.4 million. A notable portion of this increase, $47.6 million in FY2024 (compared to $3.5 million in FY2023), relates to deferred and contingent consideration for acquisitions.
• The overall increase in payables was attributed to the growth in the business and successfully negotiated improved terms with a number of suppliers, contributing to a cash inflow.
• Debtors (Receivables):
• Trade receivables increased from $136.2 million in FY2023 to $187.6 million in FY2024.
• Other receivables increased from $17.5 million in FY2023 to $25.4 million in FY2024. This category includes recoverable sales taxes, supplier deposits, and other operating debtors.
• The increase in receivables reflects the growth of the business.
The acquisition of Murat Ticaret in FY2024 was a significant factor contributing to these increases, as it is a more working capital-intensive business. Despite increases in inventories and receivables leading to cash outflows, the Group reported an improved working capital position overall, resulting in a net cash inflow for the year.

4. What is the total of other operating income

Based on the provided financial statements for Volex plc, there is no separate line item for "Other operating income" in the Consolidated Income Statement for the years ended 31 March 2024 or 2 April 2023.
The Consolidated Income Statement presents the following structure:
• Revenue
• Cost of sales
• Gross profit
• Operating expenses
• Operating profit
• Share of net profit from associates
• Finance income
• Finance costs
• Profit before taxation
While "Finance income" is disclosed separately as $1.3 million in FY2024 (compared to $0.4 million in FY2023), this is distinct from "operating income" as it relates to interest on bank deposits and preference shares. Similarly, "Share of net profit from associates" is $3.2 million in FY2024 (compared to $1.1 million in FY2023).
The detailed notes on "Profit for the period" list various expenses and gains/losses, such as net foreign exchange loss/(gain) and loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, but do not identify a category of "other operating income."
Therefore, based on the available information, Volex plc does not report a distinct "Other operating income" figure.

5. What is the in or outflow of operating non current assets

Volex plc's financial statements indicate a significant outflow of cash for the acquisition and purchase of operating non-current assets, particularly in the most recent financial year, FY2024, driven heavily by strategic acquisitions.
Here's a comparison of the cash flows related to operating non-current assets for the two most recent financial years:
• For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 (FY2024):
• Purchases of property, plant and equipment resulted in a cash outflow of $27.5 million. These are organic capital investments aimed at expanding manufacturing capacity and capabilities in high-growth areas like Electric Vehicles (EV) and data centres.
• Purchases of intangible assets (such as computer software and licences, and capitalised development costs) resulted in a cash outflow of $4.1 million.
• The acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired, primarily Murat Ticaret, was a substantial cash outflow of $134.3 million. This acquisition brought in significant non-current assets, including identifiable intangible assets of $101.9 million (customer relationships and order backlog), property, plant and equipment of $26.3 million, and right-of-use assets of $6.6 million.
• Proceeds on disposal of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment generated a small cash inflow of $0.4 million.
• For the financial year ended 2 April 2023 (FY2023):
• Purchases of property, plant and equipment resulted in a cash outflow of $14.4 million. This figure represents cash spend, while total gross capital investment including assets purchased under lease agreements was $27.0 million.
• Purchases of intangible assets resulted in a cash outflow of $3.9 million.
• The acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired, resulted in a cash outflow of $5.1 million.
• Proceeds on disposal of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment generated a minimal cash inflow of $0.1 million.
Summary and Insights: Volex plc significantly increased its investment in operating non-current assets in FY2024. The most prominent factor for this increase was the acquisition of Murat Ticaret, which expanded Volex's presence into the Off-Highway sector, diversifying its portfolio and providing immediate scale. This acquisition alone injected a substantial amount of non-current assets into the Group's balance sheet, even as it represented a significant cash outflow for the overall transaction.
Furthermore, the Group's organic capital expenditure (purchases of PP&E and intangible assets) also increased year-on-year, reflecting Volex's strategy to invest in capacity expansion and technological advancements to support future growth and customer localisation initiatives. These investment projects are generally selected based on a projected payback period of less than two years. The relatively minor proceeds from disposals indicate that the company's focus remains on expanding its asset base rather than divesting significant operational assets.

6. Fetch the interests and dividend received

The system was unable to answer.

7. What is the total investment income

Volex plc's financial statements report a category called "Finance income" which serves as the equivalent of total investment income in the provided sources.
Here's a breakdown of Volex plc's Finance income for the two most recent financial years:
• For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 (FY2024):
• The total Finance income was $1.3 million.
• This amount was solely derived from interest on bank deposits. There was no lease interest income or interest on preference shares recorded for FY2024.
• For the financial year ended 2 April 2023 (FY2023):
• The total Finance income was $0.4 million.
• This included $0.1 million from lease interest income, $0.1 million from interest on bank deposits, and $0.2 million from interest on preference shares.
Therefore, Volex plc's total investment income, reported as "Finance income", increased from $0.4 million in FY2023 to $1.3 million in FY2024. This income is distinct from the Group's operating profit, which is derived from its core business activities.

Overall, Volex plc significantly increased its investment in both organic capital expenditure and strategic acquisitions in FY2024, with the acquisition of Murat Ticaret being the most substantial purchase contributing to cash outflows.

12. What are the other investing activities

Based on Volex plc's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the "other investing activities" not previously detailed, beyond the direct acquisition or disposal of fixed assets, subsidiaries, or associates, primarily consist of interest received.
Here's the breakdown:
• Interest Received: 
• For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 (FY2024), Volex plc reported an inflow of $1.8 million from interest received. This is distinct from their "Finance income," which was $1.3 million and solely from interest on bank deposits in FY2024. The higher amount in the cash flow statement suggests it might include other types of interest cash receipts.
• For the financial year ended 2 April 2023 (FY2023), the company reported an inflow of $0.3 million from interest received. Their "Finance income" for FY2023 was $0.4 million, comprising lease interest income, interest on bank deposits, and interest on preference shares.
The significant increase in interest received in FY2024 compared to FY2023 indicates a higher return on cash balances or other interest-bearing investments.

13. Compare the net cash inflow for both years

Based on Volex plc's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, here is a comparison of the net cash inflow (or decrease) for the two most recent financial years:
• For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 (FY2024), Volex plc reported a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $6.5 million. This indicates a positive cash flow for the period.
• For the financial year ended 2 April 2023 (FY2023), the company reported a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $5.5 million. This shows a negative cash flow for that period.
Therefore, the net cash position of Volex plc significantly improved from a net decrease of $5.5 million in FY2023 to a net increase of $6.5 million in FY2024. This positive change contributed to the cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of FY2024 being $28.8 million, up from $20.7 million at the beginning of the period.

14. Show the issue of shares

Volex plc engaged in significant share issuance activities, particularly in the financial year ended 31 March 2024 (FY2024), driven primarily by a major acquisition.
Here's a breakdown of the issue of shares:
1. Equity Raise (Primary Issuance for Acquisitions)
• FY2024: Volex plc conducted a substantial equity raise which provided a cash inflow of $72.3 million. 
• This raise was completed on 22 June 2023 and involved the issuance of 21,818,181 new ordinary shares at a price of 275 pence per share.
• The total gross proceeds from this fundraising amounted to approximately £60.0 million ($74.0 million), with net proceeds of £58.6 million ($72.3 million).
• The primary purpose of this significant equity raise was to partially fund the acquisition of Murat Ticaret, a leading manufacturer of complex wire harnesses.
• The fundraising was structured via a "cash box" mechanism for the placing shares, which allowed the premium over nominal value to be recognized in retained earnings rather than a share premium account, in accordance with Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006. However, for the retail offer shares, a share premium of $1.5 million was recognized.
• Certain Directors of the company also participated in this equity raise, subscribing for 5,461,088 Placing Shares.
• FY2023: There was no significant equity raise for cash proceeds in this period.
2. Scrip Dividend Related Share Issue
Volex plc offers a scrip dividend scheme, allowing shareholders to receive new ordinary shares instead of cash dividends.
• FY2024: New ordinary shares were issued as part of the scrip dividend scheme, resulting in an increase of $2.6 million in total equity. This included: 
• 478,491 new ordinary shares for the final dividend related to the period ended 2 April 2023.
• 213,776 new fully paid ordinary shares for the interim dividend related to the current year (ended 31 March 2024).
• FY2023: New ordinary shares issued via the scrip dividend scheme contributed $1.4 million to total equity. This included: 
• 377,615 new ordinary shares for the final dividend related to the period ended 3 April 2022.
• 10,761 new ordinary shares for the interim dividend related to the period ended 2 April 2023.
In summary, the issue of shares in FY2024 was primarily driven by the large equity raise to fund the Murat Ticaret acquisition, alongside the ongoing scrip dividend scheme, indicating a period of significant capital-raising for strategic growth.


15. What is the opening gross debt

The opening gross debt for Volex plc for the financial year ended 31 March 2024 (FY2024) can be derived from the closing total borrowings at amortised cost from the prior financial year, which ended on 2 April 2023 (FY2023).
